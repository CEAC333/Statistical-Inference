##### Part 1 of the Statistical Inference Project

## Andy Tse
## August 7, 2016

### Overview

For the first part of the Statistical Inference Project, there will be 40 random exponentials and
1000 stimulations that will be analyzed. It is going to show comparisons between the sample mean versus the theoretical mean. It is also going to illustrate the differences between the sample variance and the theoretical variance.


### Simulations:
```r
lambda <- 0.2
sample_size <- 40
sims <- 1000
set.seed(12345)
sim_matrix <- matrix(rexp(sims*sample_size, rate=lambda), sims, sample_size)
sim_mean <- rowMeans(sim_matrix)
hist(sim_mean, breaks=40, prob=TRUE,main="Histogram of 40 Average Exponentials and 1000 Simulations", xlab="Mean", ylab="Frequency",
col="orange", border="red")
```

### Sample Mean Versus Theoretical Mean Comparison:


In this section, I am going to analyze the differences in order to determine the sample versus the 
theoretical mean in this project.

```r
sample_mean <- mean(sim_mean)
sample_mean
```

```r
[1] 4.971972
```

```r
theoretical_mean <- 1/lambda
theoretical_mean
```

```r
[1] 5
```

As it shows, both comparisons between the sample mean and theoretical mean are both close to each 
other statistically.

### Sample Variance Versus Theoretical Variance Comparison:

For this section, there will be an analysis for the differences for the 1000 stimulations on the 
sample variance in comparison to the theoretical variance comparisons.

```r
variable_sample_mean <- var(sim_mean)
variable_sample_mean
```

```r
[1] 0.6157926
```

```r
theoretical_var_mean <- ((1/lambda)/sqrt(sample_size))^2
theoretical_var_mean
```

```r
[1] 0.625
```

As it shows, the sample variance and theoretical variance are almost close to each other. 



### Distribution:

In this part of the project, this is the graph demonstrating the information on the 1000 simulations
in a normal distribution. 

```r
hist(sim_mean, breaks=30, prob=TRUE,main="Normal Distribution", xlab="Mean", ylab="Frequency",
col="darkred", border="purple")
xfit <- seq(min(sim_mean), max(sim_mean), length = 40)
yfit <- dnorm(xfit, mean = mean(sim_mean), sd = sd(sim_mean))
lines(xfit, yfit, lwd=6, pch=20, col="blue")
abline(v=1/lambda,col="green")

```

Based on the comparisons from the first graph and the second graphs, it has been determined that
the graph is distributed normally.
